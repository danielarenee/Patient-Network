# Patient Network Graph Generator

This C program reads patient data from a CSV file and constructs an undirected graph based on pairwise distances between patients. The program outputs adjacency information in multiple formats and generates a DOT file for visualization using Graphviz.

# Features
* Distance Calculation: Computes Euclidean distances between patients.
* Adjacency Matrix: Creates both readable and binary adjacency matrices.
* Graph Output for Visualization: Exports a .dot file for Graphviz.
* User Input: Allows input of distance threshold (r).

 # How To use
  1.  Compile the Program
  2.  Prepare Input File: Ensure Diabetes.csv is in the same directory.
  3.  Run the Program
  4.  Visualize the Graph (requires Graphviz)
	
# What I Learned!

* Graph Theory Concepts: Constructed graphs from datasets and created adjacency matrices.
* Graph Visualization: Used Graphviz to visualize networks.
